## Xcode Install ‚öôÔ∏è

- [XCversion](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcode-install)
- [Xcodes (GUI)](https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/xcodes) 

## Proxy üíª

- [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/)


## Deeplink and Universal link shortcut  üôå

- [Automator script](./deeplink-handler/open%20in%20simulator.zip)

The script let's you open a DL or UL using a string text with a keyboard shortcut. Just highligth them as if you were to copy or paste it and use the keyboard shortcut that you setup before.
The example app is from just eat, thanks to them for open source an app that has deeplinks:

## Git

### Git Worktree

Let's you work in more than a branch at the same time:

**Usage**

`git worktree add ../ios-app-dev dev`

### Git Hook üöó

- [Swift Format as post commit](./git-hooks/swift-format-hook)

let's you run swift Format on staged files after commit, all changes in format will be included in the commit.

- [Name branch hook](./git-hooks/swift-format-hook)

Takes the numeric name of the branch and add it into each commit. For example:

    [12345] My feature commit 1 
    [12345] My feature commit 2


## Simulator üöÄ

### [SimGenie](https://simgenie.app/)

Remove all permission without the need to delete the application. Gives you several and important functionalities that allows you to work with the simulator:

## Command Line Tools üõ†

### Image Manipulation
Sometimes you need to combine several screenshots from your ongoing work to easily ask details from QA or your PM. `convert` [command line tool](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) can be used to merge several images into one, crop, and resize images.
